            <p style="text-align: left;"><em style="font-size: 100px;">An ancient city that takes you back in time; where you will stand wondering about the evolution of culture, traditions and civilization. Walk further and you will be amazed by how such a historic city has a bustling urban face too.</em>
                <br><br>‘Thoonga Nagaram’ is what Madurai is popularly called in Tamil Nadu. It means ‘the city that never sleeps’. That’s true in many ways. History stays awake in this destination and the sprawling urban centre that Madurai is, offers you all the conveniences you will love for a comfortable stay. The earliest references of Madurai can be traced back to the 3rd century BC.<br><br>

                Referred to as the ‘Athens of the East’ due to the lofty towers of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple just like the Greek Pantheon, the city finds reference in many literary works of Arabs, Romans and Greek travellers like Megasthenes. Madurai also finds a place in ‘Silapathigaram’, a Sangam literature work. Befittingly, Madurai was a place of scholarly importance. Ports, prodigies, scholars and critics were a part of kingly courts that ruled Madurai over the centuries. Sangam, the confluence of Tamil scholars and critics, used to regularly convene in the city up to three times a day. <br><br>
                
                Temples, churches and palaces adorn the streets of Madurai. There is plenty to see and know about. The ancient structures are simply marvellous and speak volumes about the Dravidian architectural brilliance. Besides these, Madurai has stayed relevant as a destination through history; a factor that has seen many establishments come up in the city over the years. The place is very tourism friendly and attracts millions of visitors every year. <br><br>
                
                Though famous primarily as a pilgrimage tourism destination, Madurai also attracts visitors due to its strategic location that makes it an ideal weekend getaway.</p><br><br>
